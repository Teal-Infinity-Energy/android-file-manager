## 1. The Three Layers

OneTap is built in three layers. Each layer has a specific job:

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│            LAYER 1: Web (React)               │
│                                               │
│  What you see: buttons, forms, lists, tabs    │
│  Where it lives: src/                         │
│  Language: TypeScript + React                 │
│                                               │
│  This is where 90% of your changes happen.    │
├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│            LAYER 2: Native (Android)          │
│                                               │
│  What it does: home screen shortcuts,         │
│  notifications, PDF viewer, video player      │
│  Where it lives: native/android/              │
│  Language: Java                               │
│                                               │
│  You only touch this for Android-specific     │
│  features that the web layer can't do.        │
├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│            LAYER 3: Backend (Cloud)           │
│                                               │
│  What it does: cloud sync, Google sign-in,    │
│  URL metadata fetching                        │
│  Where it lives: supabase/                    │
│  Language: SQL (schema) + TypeScript (funcs)  │
│                                               │
│  This is OPTIONAL. The app works without it.  │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**How they connect:**

```
React UI  ──(Capacitor bridge)──▶  Native Android Java
React UI  ──(Supabase SDK)──────▶  Lovable Cloud Backend
```

Capacitor is the bridge between web and native. It lets your React code call Java functions (like "create a home screen shortcut") through a plugin system.

---

## 2. Web Layer (React + Capacitor)

**What is it?** A standard React single-page application, bundled by Vite, styled with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components.

**What is Capacitor?** Capacitor wraps your React app inside a native Android WebView. Think of it as a container that lets your web app behave like a native app. It also provides a "bridge" so your React code can call native device APIs.

**Key folders:**

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `src/components/` | UI components (buttons, forms, sheets, lists) |
| `src/components/ui/` | Low-level shadcn/ui primitives (don't edit these often) |
| `src/hooks/` | React hooks for state, auth, sync, etc. |
| `src/lib/` | Pure business logic — no React dependencies |
| `src/pages/` | Top-level page components (one per route) |
| `src/plugins/` | TypeScript interfaces for Capacitor native plugins |
| `src/types/` | TypeScript type definitions |
| `src/contexts/` | React context providers |
| `src/i18n/` | Translation files and i18next configuration |

---

## 3. Native Android Layer (Java)

**What is it?** Custom Java classes that handle things the web layer cannot do — primarily creating home screen shortcuts and firing scheduled notifications.

⚠️ **Critical rule:** Always edit files in `native/android/`. Never edit files in `android/` directly. The build script copies from `native/android/` → `android/` every time you build.

**Key classes and what they do:**

| Java Class | What It Does |
|------------|-------------|
| `MainActivity.java` | App entry point. Registers Capacitor plugins. |
| `ShortcutPlugin.java` | Creates home screen shortcuts using Android's `ShortcutManager` API |
| `NotificationHelper.java` | Displays scheduled notifications |
| `ScheduledActionReceiver.java` | Receives alarm broadcasts and triggers notifications |
| `BootReceiver.java` | Reschedules all alarms after the phone restarts |
| `NativePdfViewerActivity.java` | Full-featured PDF viewer with pinch-zoom |
| `NativeVideoPlayerActivity.java` | Video player with picture-in-picture support |
| `QuickCreateWidget.java` | Home screen widget for quick shortcut creation |
| `CrashLogger.java` | Simple crash logging (no external SDK needed) |

**Proxy Activities:** Each shortcut type has a "proxy activity" — a lightweight Java class that receives the shortcut tap and performs the action:

| Proxy | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `LinkProxyActivity` | Opens a URL in the browser |
| `ContactProxyActivity` | Initiates a phone call |
| `MessageProxyActivity` | Opens the messaging app |
| `WhatsAppProxyActivity` | Opens WhatsApp to a specific contact |
| `PDFProxyActivity` | Opens the native PDF viewer |
| `VideoProxyActivity` | Opens the native video player |
| `FileProxyActivity` | Opens a file with the system file handler |
| `SlideshowProxyActivity` | Opens a photo slideshow |
| `ShortcutEditProxyActivity` | Opens the edit screen for an existing shortcut |

---

## 4. Backend Layer (Lovable Cloud / Supabase)

**What is Supabase?** An open-source backend platform that provides a PostgreSQL database, authentication, and serverless functions. In this project, it's managed through Lovable Cloud — you don't need a separate Supabase account.

**What the backend does:**
- ✅ Stores synced bookmarks, trash, and reminders (optional)
- ✅ Handles Google OAuth sign-in
- ✅ Fetches URL metadata (title, favicon) to bypass browser CORS restrictions

**What the backend does NOT do:**
- ❌ Does not store shortcuts (those are native Android shortcuts)
- ❌ Does not run background jobs or cron tasks
- ❌ Does not send push notifications
- ❌ Does not track analytics

See [SUPABASE.md](SUPABASE.md) for the complete backend guide.

## 5. How Data Flows

### Data Ownership

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 LOCAL DEVICE                       │
│          (Source of Truth — ALWAYS)                │
│                                                    │
│  localStorage:                                     │
│    saved_links        → Your bookmarks             │
│    saved_links_trash  → Your deleted bookmarks     │
│    scheduled_actions  → Your reminders             │
│    onetap_settings    → Your preferences           │
│    sync_status        → When you last synced       │
│                                                    │
│  Android System:                                   │
│    ShortcutManager    → Your home screen shortcuts  │
│    AlarmManager       → Your scheduled reminders    │
└────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
                         │
              (optional, additive-only)
                         │
                         ▼
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                LOVABLE CLOUD                       │
│          (Backup Copy — NEVER overwrites local)    │
│                                                    │
│  cloud_bookmarks          → Copy of bookmarks      │
│  cloud_trash              → Copy of deleted items   │
│  cloud_scheduled_actions  → Copy of reminders       │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**The golden rule:** Local data always wins. If there's a conflict between what's on the device and what's in the cloud, the device version is kept. Cloud sync only *adds* items that don't already exist locally — it never updates or deletes local data.

### Sync Flow

```
User taps "Sync Now"  ──or──  App opens (daily auto)
         │
         ▼
  syncGuard.ts validates the request
         │
    ┌────┴────┐
    │ Blocked │──▶ No-op (silently ignored)
    └────┬────┘
         │ Allowed
         ▼
  Upload: Send local items to cloud
  (upsert by entity_id — same item overwrites in cloud)
         │
         ▼
  Download: Fetch cloud items
  (skip any item whose entity_id already exists locally)
         │
         ▼
  Record sync timestamp
```

---

## 6. How OAuth Works (Step by Step)

Google sign-in uses "Android App Links" — a system where Android intercepts specific HTTPS URLs and opens them in your app instead of the browser.

```
Step 1: User taps "Sign in with Google"
           │
           ▼
Step 2: App opens Google's OAuth page in a Chrome Custom Tab
        (a browser window that floats on top of the app)
           │
           ▼
Step 3: User signs in with Google
           │
           ▼
Step 4: Google redirects to:
        https://[your-domain]/auth-callback?code=ABC123
           │
           ▼
Step 5: Android intercepts this URL
        (because AndroidManifest.xml declares it as an App Link
         and assetlinks.json proves you own the domain)
           │
           ▼
Step 6: useDeepLink.ts receives the URL
           │
           ▼
Step 7: oauthCompletion.ts exchanges the code for a session
        (with idempotency — processes the same URL only once)
           │
           ▼
Step 8: User is signed in. Session stored by Supabase SDK.
```

**Files involved:**

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` | Starts the OAuth flow, manages auth state |
| `src/hooks/useDeepLink.ts` | Listens for deep links from Android |
| `src/lib/oauthCompletion.ts` | Shared logic to complete OAuth (used by both native and web) |
| `src/pages/AuthCallback.tsx` | Web-only fallback callback route |
| `public/.well-known/assetlinks.json` | Proves domain ownership to Android |
| `native/android/.../AndroidManifest.xml` | Declares the app handles the callback URL |

**What can go wrong:**

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Sign-in opens browser instead of app | Wrong SHA-256 fingerprint in `assetlinks.json` | Update fingerprint to match your signing key |
| "ES256 invalid signing" error | Callback URL not in backend's allowlist | Add the URL to Cloud → Auth Settings → URI allow list |
| Sign-in works once, then stops | Idempotency guard blocking repeat URL | Clear localStorage key `pending_oauth_url` |

---

## 7. Why No Background Services

**Philosophy:** The app is a guest on the user's device. It should not consume battery, CPU, or network in the background.

**How reminders work without background services:** OneTap uses Android's built-in `AlarmManager` to schedule notifications. The alarm is set once when you create a reminder, and Android handles the rest. `BootReceiver` reschedules alarms if the phone restarts.

**How sync works without background services:** Sync only happens when the user explicitly requests it ("Sync Now") or once per day when the app is opened. There is no background timer, no polling, and no push-triggered sync.

---

## 8. Why No Analytics

**Philosophy:** A paid app earns money from delivering value, not from surveillance. The app collects zero analytics, zero usage metrics, and zero crash telemetry to external services.

Crash logging is local-only (`CrashLogger.java`) — breadcrumbs are stored on the device and can be viewed by the developer during debugging, but are never sent anywhere.

---

## 9. Navigation Structure

The app has four bottom tabs:

```
┌──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┐
│  Access  │ Reminders│ Bookmarks│ Profile  │
│   (Zap)  │  (Bell)  │(Bookmark)│  (User)  │
└──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┘
```

| Tab | Component | Purpose |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| Access | `AccessFlow.tsx` | Create new shortcuts |
| Reminders | `NotificationsPage.tsx` | View and create scheduled reminders |
| Bookmarks | `BookmarkLibrary.tsx` | Browse and organize saved links |
| Profile | `ProfilePage.tsx` | Settings, cloud sync, account |

## 11. Build Pipeline Overview

```
Your code changes
       │
       ▼
npm run build          ← Vite bundles React app into dist/
       │
       ▼
npx cap sync android   ← Copies dist/ into the Android project
       │
       ▼
patch-android-project  ← Copies native/ files, configures Gradle
       │
       ▼
./gradlew bundleRelease  ← Produces a signed .aab file
       │
       ▼
Upload to Play Store   ← CI does this automatically (internal track)
       │
       ▼
Manual promotion       ← YOU decide when it goes to production
```

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for the full guide.

## 12. Failure Scenarios and Recovery

| Scenario | What Happens | How to Recover |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Cloud goes down** | App works perfectly. Sync button shows an error. | Wait for cloud to come back. No data is lost. |
| **User clears app data** | All local data is lost. | If signed in + synced: re-sign-in and sync to restore cloud copies. If never synced: data is gone. |
| **Phone restarts** | `BootReceiver` reschedules all alarms. Shortcuts survive. | Automatic — no action needed. |
| **Bad release shipped** | Users get a broken version. | Tag a hotfix version (`v1.0.1`), test on internal track, promote to production. See [RELEASE_PROCESS.md](RELEASE_PROCESS.md). |
| **OAuth stops working** | Users can't sign in. App still works for everything except sync. | Check `assetlinks.json` fingerprint and auth callback URL. See Section 6 above. |
| **Lost signing keystore** | Cannot publish updates to the same Play Store listing. | **Unrecoverable.** You must create a new app listing. Always back up your keystore. |
| **Sync guard blocks sync** | Sync silently does nothing. | Check console logs for `SyncGuardViolation` (dev) or warning (prod). Likely a timing issue. |
