## 1. The Big Picture

```
Your React code (src/)
        │
        ▼
    Vite bundles it into static files (dist/)
        │
        ▼
    Capacitor copies those files into an Android project
        │
        ▼
    The patch script adds your native Java code
        │
        ▼
    Gradle compiles everything into a signed .aab file
        │
        ▼
    The .aab is uploaded to Google Play Store
        │
        ▼
    Google Play distributes it to users' phones
```

**What is an AAB?** An Android App Bundle. It's the format Google Play requires. Google takes your AAB and generates optimized APKs for each device type.

## 2. Environments

| Environment | Purpose | How It Updates |
|-------------|---------|---------------|
| Lovable Preview | Web development and testing | Auto-deploys when you change code in Lovable |
| Android Debug | Testing on your phone | Built locally with `npx cap run android` |
| Android Release | Production-quality build | Built locally or by CI |
| Google Play | Distribution to real users | Manual promotion between tracks |

**There is ONE backend project.** No staging/production split. See [SUPABASE.md](SUPABASE.md) for why.

---

## 3. Prerequisites (What You Need Installed)

Before you can build locally, install these tools:

| Tool | Version | How to Install | How to Verify |
|------|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Node.js | 20+ | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) | `node --version` → should show `v20.x` or higher |
| JDK | 21 | `sudo apt install openjdk-21-jdk` (Ubuntu) | `java -version` → should show `21.x` |
| Android Studio | Latest | [developer.android.com](https://developer.android.com/studio) | Open it → SDK Manager should show |
| Android SDK | API 36 | Android Studio → SDK Manager → install API 36 | `echo $ANDROID_HOME` → should show a path |
| Physical Android phone | 8.0+ | Enable USB debugging in Developer Options | `adb devices` → should list your device |

See [ANDROID_SETUP.md](ANDROID_SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## 4. Local Build: Step by Step

### The Fast Way (Recommended)

```bash
node scripts/android/clean-rebuild-android.mjs --run
```

This single command does everything: cleans, builds, patches, syncs, and deploys to your connected phone.

### The Manual Way (If You Want to Understand Each Step)

```bash
# Step 1: Build the web app
# This runs Vite, which bundles your React code into static HTML/CSS/JS files
npm run build
# Expected: Creates a dist/ folder with your bundled app

# Step 2: Sync Capacitor
# This copies the dist/ folder into the Android project
npx cap sync android
# Expected: Updates android/app/src/main/assets/public/

# Step 3: Apply native patches
# This copies your Java files from native/android/ to android/
# and configures Gradle settings
node scripts/android/patch-android-project.mjs
# Expected: Prints messages about each file copied and setting applied

# Step 4: Run on your phone
# This compiles the Android project and installs it on your connected device
npx cap run android
# Expected: App launches on your phone
```

### After Pulling Code Changes

```bash
git pull
npm install                                    # If dependencies changed
node scripts/android/clean-rebuild-android.mjs --run  # Rebuild and run
```

---

## 5. What the Build Scripts Do

### `clean-rebuild-android.mjs`

This is your main build script. It automates the full process:

1. Deletes the `android/` folder (starts fresh)
2. Runs `npx cap add android` (creates a new Android project)
3. Runs the patch script (copies native files, configures Gradle)
4. Runs `npx cap sync android` (copies web files into Android)

**Flags:**

| Flag | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| `--run` | Also installs and launches on your phone |
| `--verify` | Also runs a Gradle build to check for errors |
| `--release` | Also builds a release AAB |
| `--warning-mode` | Shows Gradle deprecation warnings |
| `--skip-sync` | Skips the final sync step |

### `patch-android-project.mjs`

This script transforms the generic Capacitor Android project into OneTap. It:

- **Copies native files** from `native/android/` → `android/`
  - All Java classes (MainActivity, ShortcutPlugin, proxy activities, etc.)
  - AndroidManifest.xml
  - Resource files (layouts, drawables, XML configs)
- **Updates Gradle** wrapper to version 8.13
- **Configures SDK versions:** minSdk=31, compileSdk=36, targetSdk=36
- **Adds dependencies:** ExoPlayer/Media3, SwipeRefreshLayout, RecyclerView
- **Configures release signing** using environment variables
- **Removes deprecated patterns:** old Gradle syntax, jcenter repository

---

## 6. CI/CD Pipeline: What Happens Automatically

The CI/CD pipeline lives in `.github/workflows/android-release.yml`.

### What CI Does (Automatic)

```
Tag push (v1.0.0)  ──or──  Manual workflow dispatch
         │
         ▼
    Set up environment (Node 20, JDK 21, Android SDK)
         │
         ▼
    Extract version from tag (v1.2.3 → versionName: 1.2.3, versionCode: 10203)
         │
         ▼
    npm ci + npm run build (build the web app)
         │
         ▼
    npx cap add android + npx cap sync android
         │
         ▼
    Apply patches (patch-android-project.mjs)
         │
         ▼
    Decode signing keystore from GitHub Secret
         │
         ▼
    ./gradlew bundleRelease (build signed AAB)
         │
         ▼
    Upload AAB as GitHub artifact (saved for 30 days)
         │
         ▼
    Upload to Google Play (internal track by default)
         │
         ▼
    Create GitHub Release (for tag pushes)
```

### What Humans Do (Manual)

- **Decide when to release:** Tag a version when you're ready
- **Test on internal track:** Install from Play Console and verify
- **Promote to production:** Manually trigger the workflow with `track: production`, or promote in Play Console

### Required GitHub Secrets

These are stored in your GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets and Variables → Actions.

| Secret | What It Is | How to Get It |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| `KEYSTORE_BASE64` | Your signing keystore, base64-encoded | `base64 -w0 onetap-release.jks > keystore_base64.txt` |
| `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | Password for the keystore | The password you chose when creating the keystore |
| `KEY_PASSWORD` | Password for the signing key | The password you chose for the key alias |
| `PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` | Google Play API credentials | Play Console → Setup → API access → Service account → JSON key |

⚠️ **DANGER:**
If you lose or leak these secrets, your signing pipeline breaks. The `KEYSTORE_BASE64` is especially critical — if you lose the original keystore file, you cannot update the app on Play Store. Keep a backup in a secure location (not in the repo).

---

## 7. Signing Keys Explained

### What is signing?

Every Android app must be "signed" with a cryptographic key before it can be installed. This proves the app comes from you and hasn't been tampered with.

### Two types of keys

| Key | Purpose | Where It Lives |
|-----|---------|---------------|
| **Upload key** | Used to sign the AAB you upload to Google Play | Your keystore file (`onetap-release.jks`) |
| **App signing key** | Used by Google Play to sign the final APK sent to users | Managed by Google (if enrolled in Play App Signing) |

**Recommended:** Enroll in Google Play App Signing. This means even if you lose your upload key, Google still has the app signing key and you can reset your upload key. Without enrollment, losing your keystore means you can never update the app.

### Creating a keystore (one-time)

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore onetap-release.jks \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 \
  -alias onetap-key
```

You will be prompted for:
- A keystore password (remember this — you need it for every build)
- Your name, organization, etc. (can be anything)
- A key password (can be the same as keystore password)

⚠️ **DANGER:**
**Back up this file immediately.** Store it in a secure location outside of your repository (e.g., a password manager, encrypted cloud storage). If you lose it AND you didn't enroll in Play App Signing, you cannot update the app. Ever.

## 8. How Version Codes Work

Every Android app has two version identifiers:

| Identifier | Example | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `versionName` | `1.2.3` | Human-readable. Shown to users in Play Store. |
| `versionCode` | `10203` | Machine-readable. Must increase with every release. |

**The formula:** `major × 10000 + minor × 100 + patch`

| Tag | versionName | versionCode |
|-----|-------------|-------------|
| v1.0.0 | 1.0.0 | 10000 |
| v1.0.1 | 1.0.1 | 10001 |
| v1.2.3 | 1.2.3 | 10203 |
| v2.0.0 | 2.0.0 | 20000 |

**Rule:** The `versionCode` must always be higher than the previous release. Google Play will reject your upload if it's equal or lower.

---

## 9. How to Test Release Builds Safely

### Google Play has four "tracks" (release channels):

| Track | Who Can See It | Purpose |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| Internal | Only people you've added as testers | Quick testing before any public release |
| Alpha (Closed) | Invited testers only | Early access testing |
| Beta (Open) | Anyone who opts in | Wider testing |
| Production | Everyone | Public release |

### Safe testing process:

1. **Tag a version:** `git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0`
2. **Wait for CI:** Check GitHub Actions — the build should succeed and upload to the internal track
3. **Install from internal track:** Open Play Console → Internal testing → copy the test link → install on your phone
4. **Test everything:** All shortcut types, reminders, sync, offline mode
5. **If it works:** Promote to production (see [RELEASE_PROCESS.md](RELEASE_PROCESS.md))
6. **If it's broken:** Fix the issue, tag a new patch version (`v1.0.1`), repeat

## 10. Build Outputs

| Output | Location | What It's For |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| Web assets | `dist/` | The bundled React app |
| Debug APK | `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/` | Testing on your phone |
| Release AAB | `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/` | Uploading to Play Store |
| ProGuard mapping | `android/app/build/outputs/mapping/release/` | Translating crash reports to readable code |

---

## 11. Edge Functions

Edge functions deploy automatically when you push code changes to your Lovable project. You do not need to deploy them manually.

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `fetch-url-metadata` | Fetches page title and favicon for URLs (bypasses CORS) |
| `delete-account` | Deletes user's cloud data and auth account |

---

## 12. Common Failures and Fixes

| Problem | What You See | How to Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **Device not found** | `adb devices` shows nothing | Enable USB debugging, try a different cable, run `adb kill-server && adb start-server` |
| **Java version wrong** | `Cannot find Java installation matching: {languageVersion=21}` | Install JDK 21: `sudo apt install openjdk-21-jdk` and set `JAVA_HOME` |
| **Gradle wrapper missing** | `spawn ./gradlew ENOENT` | Run: `cd android && gradle wrapper && cd ..` |
| **Build fails after code change** | Various Gradle errors | Run the clean rebuild: `node scripts/android/clean-rebuild-android.mjs` |
| **AAB not created** | CI step "Verify AAB" fails | Check the Gradle build log for errors (usually a Java compilation issue in native code) |
| **Play Store upload fails** | CI publish step fails | Check `PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` secret is correct and the service account has "Release manager" role |
| **Version code too low** | Play Store rejects upload | Your version tag must be higher than the last published version |
| **Signing error** | `keystore was tampered with, or password was incorrect` | Check `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` and `KEY_PASSWORD` secrets match your keystore |

### If the CI pipeline itself breaks:

You can always build locally as a fallback:

```bash
npm run build
npx cap sync android
node scripts/android/patch-android-project.mjs
cd android && ./gradlew bundleRelease
# Upload the AAB manually via Play Console
```
